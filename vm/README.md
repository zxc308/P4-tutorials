# Introduction

This directory is here only for historical reference.  The scripts
here _might_ still be useful for creating a VM image based on Ubuntu
16.04 Linux, but free support and updates for that version of Ubuntu
Linux ended in April 2021.  The VM created by these scripts also rely
upon and install Python2 versions of several Python libraries, which
the latest version of the tutorials repository no longer uses.

See the `vm-ubuntu-24.04` [directory](../vm-ubuntu-24.04) for similar
scripts that can be used to create a VM image based on Ubuntu 24.04
Linux, and uses only Python3.
